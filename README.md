PEPE only, because the frog is unique. 🐸

1. How can we help?
Right now we are running at Seporlia testnet, check the info bellow how to connect, setup a wallet at this testnet and use Uniswap. This way you can swap and help us to test it. In case you have some experience with bots for Uniswap please let us know, we have to create some to use on the test.

## Basics of a Stable coin
Any stable coin is based in underlying assets to keep its value relative to the dollar or any other asset it represents. The best known stable coin is USDT managed by Tether.
How Tether keeps their token always set for 1 USDT = 1 dollar? They control the supply of the token using lots of automated trading bots, when the customers of some exchange tries to sell they can buy at same percentage to keep the value almost equal to one dollar always. Even at high demand for the token we barely see its depeging, its not common such situations and when they happen, often crypto traders won't bother paying much attention.
In case of the pepeUSD we aim to make a token, exactly with the same characteristcs of USDT ERC-20 but, this time based not on cash but on $PEPE.
$PEPE is high volatile, which is good since we can break to 10x, 20x we don't know, even when it falls 90% we still can have some profits from previous pumps. It definitively can impose some challenges, but, we know that running enough arbitrage bots we can make the peg.
If one dollar equates to aproximately 648035.52 $PEPE at current prices, it means that, when $PEPE goes down, one dollar will buy more $PEPE, we have to start selling $PEPE and buying pepeUSD to compensate the fall. 
The same logic applied to when $PEPE goes up, we have to sell pepeUSD and buy $PEPE to keep the same value.

### A stable coin managed by community
$PEPE community is vibrant and would able to hold pepeUSD, run some arbitrage bots to keep the value correct at Uniswap pools and actively trade their own stable based in the token they love.
The main challenges are decentralization and the fair distribution of the pepeUSD, the community should decide whats best since the distribution of a stable can lead to complex situations when bad actors would try to hijack all resources for themselves.
In order to avoid such situations, the team behind this project should be contacted by many important leaders from $PEPE community objecting gain trust and discuss ideas to mitigate potential risks.
This is a project for $PEPE community, and it must remain like that.
